Fishing Game

This is a very simple little fishing game that I wrote as a
class demo with my Intro Programming in Python class.

Invoke the game with "python3 fishing.py". When it tells you
to "Prepare to fish!", say "fisher" and your fisher name,
for example "fisher Alice".

When the game tells you to "Fish!", you can hit return or
say "cast" to cast, or you can say "quit" to quit. Your high
score is tracked.
